# KNN-Classifier-from-scratch
KNN Classifier has been implemented from scratch.

## KNN to predit digits

KNN classifier has been implemented to predict digits from handwritten images.Images have been featurized as vectors in the dataset.
Euclidean Distance and Manhattan distances have been used to find the nearest.Majority voting is done to pick the best match from k nearest neighbors.
Experimentation has been done with different values of k to get best results.


## KNN to classify set of features in Mushroom

KNN classifier has been implemented to classify given set of features in Mushroom Database.Features are categorical.Missing values have been replaced with mode.
Euclidean Distance and Manhattan distances have been used to find the nearest.Majority voting is done to pick the best match from k nearest neighbors.
Experimentation has been done with different values of k to get best results.
